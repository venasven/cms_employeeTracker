#CMS Employee Tracker
## Description
Meant to be a CMS program that is user friendly. I struggled a lot with this code, and admit that this is still a work in progress. I'm having a hard time with the syntax, but have gotten a few functions to work properly. You are able to view all the departments, roles, and employees. Also these are all listed in human readbable ways to make the app more friendly to the non coder. I have provided a video below showing what I have so far.
